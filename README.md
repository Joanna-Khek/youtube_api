# Data Analysis Project using Youtube API
In this project, I will be analysing one of my favourite youtube channel *BeatEmUps*. I have been following this channel for a really long time and I have to say that *Wood Hawker* (content creater of this channel) is extremely creative. His videos never fail to put a smile on my face! 

I wanted to do an analysis of his channel to find out the following questions:  

- How many videos uploaded by year?
- When are the videos usually uploaded?
- Are there any correlation between number of views, likes and comments?
- What are the best performing videos?
- What are the worst performing videos?
