165,oIJOcZyOTMc,Fan Mail Videos are CANCELLED,"Cancelling these videos for now for obvious reasons. Don't send me anything, don't go the post office, don't leave your house. Stay safe, wash your hands.

ALSO: This was recorded about 2 weeks ago and the packages had been in my house since before the shutdowns went into effect.

Going to just wait on the Giveaway until i'm actually able to send it, otherwise i'll end up picking a winner who will have to wait for probably months. There will be an even BIGGER giveaway in the next one of these videos (which will be whenever this is all over) to make up for it.

Be sure to Subscribe to this Channel and Super Dereks Channel! www.youtube.com/superderekyt

The plan was to edit this down to be much much shorter but watching it back we didn't want to cut out any of the games or stories we told, so you get the full, raw, 35 minutes of us talking. I know this video isn't going to appeal to everyone out there and I am sorry about that, but being on holiday right now this was much less time consuming for me to edit and also great for me to watch back 3 years from now and remember everything that happened at this years PRGE!! 

Thank you to everyone for watching and everyone who made PRGE special for me :)
